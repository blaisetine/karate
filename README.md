# karate

My fighting game written in Pascal during childhood.

The operating system is MS DOS, so this is running under emulation.

I was a big fan of street figher and wanted to build my own game.

I was much harder thn I though :-(

I had to draw everything by hand, even for the music I had to write the digital frequencies for each note by hand.
